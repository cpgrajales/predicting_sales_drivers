# predicting_sales_drivers
This is our sponsored capstone project by a manufacturing company. The company is only asking for data visualizations that generate reports but our group decided also to make a web application which will help them predict future sales per week. We tried and tested more than 400 models but ended up to use Random Forest since it has the lowest rmse, which means it has the lowest error in predictions. But then again, we say that the model can only perform to some extent because of 2 things: 1.) we only have one year's worth of data and 2.) the RMSE is still quite high considering that our unit sales target ranges from mostly 2-8.
